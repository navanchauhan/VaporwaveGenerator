# ｖａｐｏｒｗａｖｅ　ｇｅｎｅｒａｔｏｒ　旺育栄

A ｖａｐｏｒｗａｖｅ music (+art, +video soon, I promise) generator bodged together using code from various sources. Runs on Python3

```
usage: main.py [-h] [-M] [-P] [-V] [-i INPUT]

This program takes YouTube URL or title of a song and converts it into
vaporwave

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -M, --music           generate v a p o r w a v e music
  -P, --picture         generate VHS Style image
  -V, --version         show program version
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT

```

If the program gives an error for sox, try running `ulimit -n 999'`

## Demo

### M U S I C

Linking to Bandcamp soon

### V H S  I M A G E

#### Input

![](assets/in-vhs.jpg?raw=true "Input VHS")

#### Output

![](assets/out-vhs.jpg?raw=true "Output VHS")

## Installation

This was tested on macOS Catalina ( so should work on almost all macOS versions).
Windows is unsupported at this time ( I need to find a way to use aubio's python module)

### Dependencies

#### Linux

```
sudo apt install ffmpeg libavl1 sox
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### macOS

Make sure you have brew installed

```
brew install noah # I would have had to re-compile the executeable :(
brew install sox
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### M U S I C

#### YouTube URL
```
python3 main.py -M -i <YOUTUBE_URL>
```
#### Song Title
```
python3 main.py -M -i Song Title
```

### V H S  I M A G E S

`python3 main.py -P -i "image.jpg"`

## Bugs

This project is a result of bodging and therefore has tons of bugs which need to be ironed out

## To-Do

[] Move away from using os.system calls, and use Python modules instead ( Looking at you, Sox and aubio)
[] Clean the Code
[] Add Artwork Generator
[x] VHS Picture Styler ( Added in v1.5 )
[] Add Video Generator
[] Add Custom Date to VHS Styler
